# Checkpoint 2 notes

- The tst_rast program is fully functioning
- The tst_rend program is non functioning, sometimes. We have noticed the program has 3 run states:
    1. The program hits an error, shows 2 bombs on screen and exits with a -1 status code
    2. The program succesfully runs, plots the doodle and the monster in the correct position
    3. If 2 happens, this stage happens after, gulam crashes
- The tst_mod, is non functioning.
