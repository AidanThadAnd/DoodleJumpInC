# DoodleJumpCGame

## What is this project?
Doodle Jump is a recreation of a popular mobile endless jumper game, I've recreated it into a simple monochrome game for the Atari ST. It was written in C/68000 ASM, with the goal of using no operating system features (aside from the supervisor toggle to access restricted memory). Everything in this remake was written from scratch, including the raster library, sound generation library, custom interrupt vectors, and keyboard/mouse drivers.
